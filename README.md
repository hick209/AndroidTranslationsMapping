# Android Translations Mapping

Maps single `strings.xml` file into multiple XML files


## Setup

Have [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) installed.

Open the file `Main.kt` in package `com.wwn.kickoff.translations`

Adjust the correct paths (and possibly languages).
 - Path to the resource folder in the Android project
 - Path to the resource folder with the new strings
 - Path of the JSON mapping file (in KO project, this should be on folder `translations/` in the root of the Android project)

Run the project with Gradle
